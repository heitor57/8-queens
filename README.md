# Eight Queens problem
The Eight Queens problem is a commonly used problem in computer science to demonstrate the concept of backtracking. The problem involves placing eight queens on a chessboard in such a way that no two queens attack each other.

This problem is a classic example of a constraint satisfaction problem in the field of artificial intelligence and operations research.

The problem has various applications, such as air traffic control, VLSI testing (Sosic, 1990), load balancing (Panwar et al., 2013), and deadlock prevention (Tanik, 1978).

This work aims to solve the problem using graph modeling, and it also explores the generalized n-queens problem.

The problem is solved using a backtracking algorithm for solution search, and the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm is used for validating the board state.

# Usage
